1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjucius/cozi-mcp.git
cd cozi-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Start the development playground:
```bash
uv run playground
```

## Usage

### Cloud Deployment (Smithery.ai)

Once deployed on Smithery.ai, your MCP server runs in the cloud and can be accessed by any MCP-compatible AI assistant using the provided endpoint URL.

### Local Development & Testing

Test the server locally with the interactive playground:
```bash
# Start the interactive playground
uv run playground

# Or start development server
uv run dev
```

The playground provides a web interface to test all MCP tools with real-time responses and debugging information.

### Integration with AI Assistants

The easiest way to integrate this MCP server is through the [Smithery.ai server page](https://smithery.ai/server/@mjucius/cozi_mcp), which provides step-by-step instructions for your specific AI assistant.

For advanced users doing local development, the server can be run locally using the stdio interface.

## Architecture

This MCP server is built using:
- **FastMCP** - Simplified MCP server framework  
- **Smithery.ai** - Cloud deployment and credential management
- **py-cozi-client** - Python client library for Cozi's API
- **Pydantic models** - All API responses use structured data models

The server maintains a single authenticated session with Cozi and exposes all functionality through the MCP protocol. When deployed on Smithery.ai, credentials are securely managed through the platform's configuration system.
