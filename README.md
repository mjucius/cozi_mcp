# Cozi MCP Server

An unofficial Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants like Claude Desktop with access to [Cozi Family Organizer](https://www.cozi.com/) functionality. This server exposes Cozi's lists, calendar, and family management features through a standardized MCP interface so you can ask your AI to manage events and lists for you.

## Installation & Deployment

### Option 1: Cloud Deployment with Smithery.ai (Recommended)

Deploy directly to Smithery.ai for secure, cloud-hosted MCP server:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Connect your GitHub to [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai)
3. Deploy this project and configure your Cozi credentials securely in the dashboard
4. Use the deployed MCP server URL in your AI assistant

### Option 2: Local Development

1. Install dependencies with uv (recommended):
```bash
uv sync
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

2. For local testing, use the Smithery playground:
```bash
uv run playground
```

3. For Claude Desktop integration, set up credentials as environment variables

## Usage

### Cloud Deployment (Smithery.ai)

Once deployed on Smithery.ai, your MCP server runs in the cloud and can be accessed by any MCP-compatible AI assistant using the provided endpoint URL.

### Local Development & Testing

Test the server locally with the interactive playground:
```bash
# Start the interactive playground
uv run playground

# Or start development server
uv run dev
```

The playground provides a web interface to test all MCP tools with real-time responses and debugging information.

### Integration with Claude Desktop

#### Using Smithery.ai Deployment (Recommended)

Use the cloud-deployed server URL from Smithery.ai:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cozi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-http", "YOUR_SMITHERY_URL"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Local Installation

For local development, use the stdio interface:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cozi": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/src/cozi_mcp/server.py"],
      "env": {
        "COZI_USERNAME": "your-email@example.com",
        "COZI_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture

This MCP server is built using:
- **FastMCP** - Simplified MCP server framework  
- **Smithery.ai** - Cloud deployment and credential management
- **py-cozi-client** - Python client library for Cozi's API
- **Pydantic models** - All API responses use structured data models

The server maintains a single authenticated session with Cozi and exposes all functionality through the MCP protocol. When deployed on Smithery.ai, credentials are securely managed through the platform's configuration system.
